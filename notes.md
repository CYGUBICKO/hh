**Steve:**

- Think about whether he wants to focus on the thesis or he can work on Covid stuff for now and get back to JD by next week. inquire what the rules are for the CSE thesis proposal and also focus on completing the procesal and how much time he has for this.Document all the ideas, questions and possible choices to be made on handling WaSH predictors and overall analysis ideas. Also, try to figure out what APHRC did and why we think we can do something different. Redo some of the visualizations/summaries of the key variables we had done before.


**JD:**

- Share some links on model centering and predictions and also confirm if we can schedule for a meeting to discuss this.
